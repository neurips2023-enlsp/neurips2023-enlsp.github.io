In this paper, we discuss directions to improve upon the conventional TDNN architecture to render it more generally applicable. More specifically, we explore the utility of performing pooling operations across different levels of the convolutional stack and further propose an approach to efficiently combine such set of representations. We show that the resulting models are more versatile, in the sense that a fixed architecture can be re-used across different tasks, and learned representations are more discriminative. Evaluations are performed across two settings: (1) two sub-tasks for spoofing attack detection, and (2) three sub-tasks for spoken language identification. Results show the proposed design yielding improvements over the original TDNN architecture, as well as other previously proposed methods.</p></div><div class="modal-footer"><a href="/papers/2/CameraReady/ENLSP_MLTDNN.pdf" download="" class="btn btn-primary active" aria-current="page">Download PDF</a><button type="button" class="btn btn-secondary" data-bs-dismiss="modal">Close</button></div></div></div></div>

We propose a novel method, REDE, based on adaptive representation learning and density estimation. REDE can be applied to zero/few-shots cases, and quickly learn a high-performing detector that is comparable to the full-supervision setting with only a few shots by updating less than 3K parameters. We demonstrate REDE's competitive performance on DSTC9 Track 1 dataset and our newly collected test set.</p></div><div class="modal-footer"><a href="/papers/3/CameraReady/OOD_ENLSP_NeurIPS_workshop.pdf" download="" class="btn btn-primary active" aria-current="page">Download PDF</a><button type="button" class="btn btn-secondary" data-bs-dismiss="modal">Close</button></div></div></div></div>

To this end, we propose a novel representation learning based method by combining unsupervised clustering and contrastive learning so that better data representations for OOD detection can be learned. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that this method can be even competitive to the state-of-the-art supervised approaches with label information.</p></div><div class="modal-footer"><a href="/papers/4/CameraReady/OOD_ENLSP_NeurIPS_workshop_unsupervised.pdf" download="" class="btn btn-primary active" aria-current="page">Download PDF</a><button type="button" class="btn btn-secondary" data-bs-dismiss="modal">Close</button></div></div></div></div>

This assumption is usually unrealistic since the token-level annotations required by NER training are laborious and scarce, especially for new (unseen) classes. We present the first work to study continual few-shot learning for NER, which is more general, but as a result, more challenging, compared to continual learning for NER. To alleviate the problem of catastrophic forgetting in continual few-shot learning, we reconstruct synthetic training data of the previously seen classes from the NER model and further develop a framework that distills from the existing model with both synthetic data, and real data from the current training set. Experimental results on several NER benchmarks show that our approach achieves significant improvements over existing baselines.</p></div><div class="modal-footer"><a href="/papers/6/CameraReady/ENLSP.pdf" download="" class="btn btn-primary active" aria-current="page">Download PDF</a><button type="button" class="btn btn-secondary" data-bs-dismiss="modal">Close</button></div></div></div></div>

Amortized or approximate computational methods increase efficiency, but can come with unpredictable performance costs. In this work, we present CATs---Confident Adaptive Transformers---in which we simultaneously increase computational efficiency, while \emph{guaranteeing} a specifiable degree of consistency with the original model with high confidence. Our method trains additional prediction heads on top of intermediate layers, and dynamically decides when to stop allocating computational effort to each input using a meta consistency classifier. To calibrate our early prediction stopping rule, we formulate a unique extension of conformal prediction.

While people may quickly determine learning paths over concepts in a domain, finding such paths in other domains can be challenging. We introduce Domain-Adversarial Variational Graph Autoencoders (DAVGAE) to solve this cross-domain prerequisite chain learning task efficiently. Our novel model consists of a variational graph autoencoder (VGAE) and a domain discriminator. The VGAE is trained to predict concept relations through link prediction, while the domain discriminator takes both source and target domain data as input and is trained to predict domain labels. Most importantly, this method only needs simple homogeneous graphs as input, compared with the current state-of-the-art model. We evaluate our model on the LectureBankCD dataset, and results show that our model outperforms recent graph-based benchmarks while using only 1/10 of graph scale and 1/3 computation time.</p></div><div class="modal-footer"><a href="/papers/8/CameraReady/ENSLP.pdf" download="" class="btn btn-primary active" aria-current="page">Download PDF</a><button type="button" class="btn btn-secondary" data-bs-dismiss="modal">Close</button></div></div></div></div>

However, full fine-tuning of the LM for UDA may lead to learned knowledge being distorted, and the full fine-tuned LM is also expensive for deployment. This paper explores an adapter-based fine-tuning approach for unsupervised domain adaptation. Specifically, several trainable adapter modules are inserted in a pre-trained LM, and the embedded generic knowledge is preserved by fixing the parameters of the original LM at fine-tuning. A domain-fusion scheme is introduced to train these adapters using a corpus from mixed domains to capture transferable features better. Elaborated experiments on two benchmark datasets are carried out, and the results demonstrate that our approach is effective with different tasks, dataset sizes, and domain similarities.</p></div><div class="modal-footer"><a href="/papers/9/CameraReady/NeurIPS2021_UDA_with_adapter.pdf" download="" class="btn btn-primary active" aria-current="page">Download PDF</a><button type="button" class="btn btn-secondary" data-bs-dismiss="modal">Close</button></div></div></div></div>

In this work, we study several approaches to the design of on-device voice cloning. Starting from a multi-speaker TTS system we improve its quality for a target speaker by fine-tuning the feature generation module on a small speech sample. We compare the performance of a feature generation module based on conventional Tacotron2 with step-wise monotonic attention with the ones based on Non-attentive Tacotron and Glow-TTS. We show that Non-attentive Tacotron significantly outperforms the attention-based model and demonstrate that a compact on-device TTS system of good quality can be obtained using only 1 minute of adaptation data with no more than 200 iterations of SGD corresponding to less than 1 hour of on-device training time on a consumer mobile phone.</p></div><div class="modal-footer"><a href="/papers/11/CameraReady/NeurIPS_Workshop_2021__VC_with_few_samples_final.pdf" download="" class="btn btn-primary active" aria-current="page">Download PDF</a><button type="button" class="btn btn-secondary" data-bs-dismiss="modal">Close</button></div></div></div></div>

In this paper, we explore how to efficiently build NMT models in an FL setup by proposing a novel solution. In order to reduce the communication overhead, out of all neural layers we only exchange what we term ``Controller'' layers.  Controllers are a small number of additional neural components connected to our pre-trained architectures. These new components are placed in between original layers. They act as liaisons to communicate with the central server and learn minimal information that is sufficient enough to update clients.   We evaluated the performance of our models on five datasets from different domains to translate from German into English. We noted that the models equipped with Controllers preform on par with those trained in a central and non-FL setting. In addition, we observed a substantial reduction in the communication traffic of the FL pipeline, which is a direct consequence of using Controllers. Based on our experiments, Controller-based models are 6 times less expensive than their other peers. This reduction is significantly important when we consider the number of parameters in large models and it becomes even more critical when such parameters need to be exchanged for multiple rounds in FL settings.  </p></div><div class="modal-footer"><a href="/papers/12/CameraReady/nurips_fl_6page (3).pdf" download="" class="btn btn-primary active" aria-current="page">Download PDF</a><button type="button" class="btn btn-secondary" data-bs-dismiss="modal">Close</button></div></div></div></div>

However, there exists semantic confusion between language and vision during the pre-training stage. Moreover, current pre-trained models tend to take lots of computation resources for fine-tuning when transferred to downstream tasks. In this work, we present a simple but effective approach for Adaptive Fine-tuning of Vision and Language pre-trained models, namely AFVL. Specifically, we introduce a pair-wise contrastive loss to learn alignments between the whole sentence and each image in the same batch during the pre-training process. At the fine-tuning stage, we introduce two lightweight adaptation networks to reduce model parameters and increase training speed for saving computation resources. We evaluate our CAVL on four main downstream tasks, including Visual Question Answering (VQA), Visual Commonsense Reasoning (VCR), Natural Language for Visual Reasoning (NLVR), and Region-to-Phrase Grounding (RPG). Compared to previous methods, our AFVL achieves comparable or better results while saving training time and GPU memory by a large margin for fine-tuning. Extensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate the efficiency of contrastive pre-training and adaptive fine-tuning proposed in our AFVL.</p></div><div class="modal-footer"><a href="/papers/14/CameraReady/[Camera-Ready] ENLSP2021_AFVL.pdf" download="" class="btn btn-primary active" aria-current="page">Download PDF</a><button type="button" class="btn btn-secondary" data-bs-dismiss="modal">Close</button></div></div></div></div>

TinyBERT addresses the computational efficiency by self-distilling BERT into a smaller transformer representation having fewer layers and smaller internal embedding. However, TinyBERT's performance drops when we reduce the number of layers by 50\%, and drops even more abruptly when we reduce the number of layers by 75\% for advanced NLP tasks such as span question answering.  Additionally, a separate model must be trained for each inference scenario with its distinct computational budget.

In this paper, we study the application of pre-trained LLM for Click-through-rate (CTR) prediction for product advertisement in e-commerce. This is challenging because the model needs to a) learn from language as well as tabular data features, b) maintain low-latency (&lt;5 ms) at inference time, and c) adapt to constantly changing advertisement distribution. We first show that scaling the pre-trained language model to 1.5 billion parameters significantly improves performance over conventional CTR baselines. We then present CTR-BERT, a novel lightweight cache-friendly factorized model for CTR prediction that consists of twin-structured BERT-like encoders for text with a mechanism for late fusion for text and tabular features. We train the CTR-BERT model using cross-architecture knowledge distillation (KD) and empirically study the interaction between KD and distribution shift in this setting, by a) experimenting with pre-training, distillation pre-finetuning and fine-tuning strategies b) factorizing features based on their distribution shift time scales, that allows the model to readily adapt and be re-trained. Finally, we show that CTR-BERT significantly outperforms a traditional CTR baseline with a 2.3\% relative ROC-AUC lift in offline experiments and a 2\% CTR lift in an online experiment.  </p></div><div class="modal-footer"><a href="/papers/20/CameraReady/camera_ready_final.pdf" download="" class="btn btn-primary active" aria-current="page">Download PDF</a><button type="button" class="btn btn-secondary" data-bs-dismiss="modal">Close</button></div></div></div></div>

However, most pre-trained models suffer from low inference speed. Deploying such large models to applications with latency constraints is challenging. In this work, we focus on accelerating the inference via conditional computations. To achieve this, we propose a novel idea, Magic Pyramid (MP), to reduce both width-wise and depth-wise computation via token pruning and early exiting for Transformer-based models, particularly BERT. The former manages to save the computation via removing non-salient tokens, while the latter can fulfill the computation reduction by terminating the inference early before reaching the final layer, if the exiting condition is met. Our empirical studies demonstrate that compared to previous state of arts, MP is not only able to achieve a speed-adjustable inference, but also to surpass token pruning and early exiting by reducing up to 70% giga floating point operations (GFLOPs) with less than 0.5% accuracy drop. Token pruning and early exiting express distinctive preferences to sequences with different lengths. However, MP is capable of achieving an average of 8.06x speedup on two popular text classification tasks, regardless of the sizes of the inputs.</p></div><div class="modal-footer"><a href="/papers/21/CameraReady/magic_pyramid.pdf" download="" class="btn btn-primary active" aria-current="page">Download PDF</a><button type="button" class="btn btn-secondary" data-bs-dismiss="modal">Close</button></div></div></div></div>

Recent developments in artificial intelligence (AI) have led to high-accuracy ASR systems based on deep neural networks, such as the recurrent neural network transducer (RNN-T). However, the core components and the performed operations of these approaches depart from the powerful biological counterpart, i.e., the human brain. On the other hand, the current developments in biologically-inspired ASR models, based on spiking neural networks (SNNs), lag behind in terms of accuracy and focus primarily on small scale applications. In this work, we revisit the incorporation of biologically-plausible models into deep learning and we substantially enhance their capabilities, by taking inspiration from the diverse neural and synaptic dynamics found in the brain. In particular, we introduce neural connectivity concepts emulating the axo-somatic and the axo-axonic synapses. Based on this, we propose novel deep learning units with enriched neuro-synaptic dynamics and integrate them into the RNN-T architecture. We demonstrate for the first time, that a biologically realistic implementation of a large-scale ASR model can yield competitive performance levels compared to the existing deep learning models.

In contrast to many of state-of-the-art compression methods where intensive pre-training of the compressed model is necessary, progressive LRD can provide promising performance by compressing the model in the fine-tuning stage.

The state-of-the-art NER models are based on deep learning and require enough labeled data. In practice, the labeled data for NER is usually limited, as providing accurate labels to the sentences is very time consuming. With an NER model trained on limited labeled data, it is desirable to develop an efficient mechanism to collect data labels and improve the model over time. To achieve this, existing works develop active learning approaches. However, these approaches are usually developed for annotators and assume the annotators will provide the exactly correct labels to each sentence selected to label. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective user-in-the-loop feedback mechanism to enable end users, instead of annotators, to easily provide labels to the system. We identify counterfactual bias of the data collected by this feedback mechanism. To alleviate the bias and achieve more sample-efficient learning, we further develop a counterfactual NER learning framework. We develop an imputation model to estimate the loss in those non-displayed entity classes. By considering both losses on displayed and non-displayed entity classes, we can efficiently alleviate such display bias in the NER model. With extensive experiments, we validate the effectiveness of our feedback mechanism and learning framework.</p></div><div class="modal-footer"><a href="/papers/29/CameraReady/camera_User_in_the_Loop_Named_Entity_Recognition.pdf" download="" class="btn btn-primary active" aria-current="page">Download PDF</a><button type="button" class="btn btn-secondary" data-bs-dismiss="modal">Close</button></div></div></div></div>

We find that under two pruning strategies (element-wise and rank pruning), the approach with the multitask objective outperforms training models separately when averaged across all tasks, and it is competitive on each individual one.

The success of GPT is mostly attributed to its pre-training on huge amount of data and its large number of parameters (from 100M to billions of parameters). Despite the superior performance of GPT (especially in few-shot or zero-shot setup), this overparameterized nature of GPT can be very prohibitive for deploying this model on devices with limited computational power or memory. This problem can be mitigated using model compression techniques; however, compressing GPT models has not been investigated much in the literature. In this work, we use Kronecker decomposition to compress the linear mappings of the GPT-2 model.
