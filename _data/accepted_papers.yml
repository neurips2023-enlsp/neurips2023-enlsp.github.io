"abstract": "Deep neural networks (DNNs) have improved NLP tasks significantly, but training and maintaining such networks could be costly. Model compression techniques, such as, knowledge distillation (KD), have been proposed to address the issue; however, the compression process could be lossy. Motivated by this, our work investigates how a distilled student model differs from its teacher, if the distillation process causes any information losses, and if the loss follows a specific pattern. Our experiments tries to shed light on what types of tasks might be less or more sensitive to KD by reporting data points on the contribution of different factors, such as the number of layers or attention heads. Results such as ours could be utilized when determining effective and efficient configurations to achieve an optimal information transfer between larger (teacher) and smaller (student) models.",

"abstract": "Today, the exponential rise of large models developed by academic and industrial institutions with the help of massive computing resources raises the question of whether someone without access to such resources can make a valuable scientific contribution. To explore this, we tried to solve the challenging task of multilingual image retrieval having a limited budget of $1,000. As a result, we present NLLB-CLIP - CLIP model with a text encoder from the NLLB model. To train the model, we used an automatically created dataset of 106,246 good-quality images with captions in 201 languages derived from the LAION COCO dataset. We trained multiple models using image and text encoders of various sizes and kept different parts of the model frozen during the training. We thoroughly analyzed the trained models using existing evaluation datasets and newly created XTD200 and Flickr30k-200 datasets. We show that NLLB-CLIP is comparable in quality to state-of-the-art models and significantly outperforms them on low-resource languages.",

"abstract": "Prompt tuning (PT), where a small amount of trainable soft (continuous) prompt vectors is affixed to the input of language models (LM), has shown promising results across various tasks and models for parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT). PT stands out from other PEFT approaches because it maintains competitive performance with fewer trainable parameters and does not drastically scale up its parameters as the model size expands. However, PT introduces additional soft prompt tokens, leading to longer input sequences, which significantly impacts training and inference time and memory usage due to the Transformer's quadratic complexity. Particularly concerning for Large Language Models (LLMs) that face heavy daily querying. To address this issue, we propose Decomposed Prompt Tuning (DePT), which decomposes the soft prompt into a shorter soft prompt and a pair of low-rank matrices that are then optimised with two different learning rates. This allows DePT to achieve better performance while saving over 20% memory and time costs compared to vanilla PT and its variants, without changing trainable parameter sizes. Through extensive experiments on 21 natural language processing (NLP) , we demonstrate that DePT outperforms state-of-the-art PEFT approaches, including the full fine-tuning baseline in some scenarios. Additionally, we empirically show that DEPT grows more efficient as the model size increases.",

"abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance across various tasks. Nevertheless, deploying LLMs on edge devices presents significant challenges, primarily due to their substantial model size (e.g., over 10 billion parameters). Low-precision quantization is a promising way to reduce the memory requirement of LLMs. However, directly applying ultra-low-bit quantization to LLMs leads to significant performance degradation and fails to meet a specific weight memory budget. In this paper, we propose LLM-MQ, a Mixed-precision Quantization method, to address the above issues. Our method mainly contains three folds: (1) We propose a sparse outlier protection strategy for low-precision layers by protecting the outliers in FP16 format to maintain the performance. (2) We propose sensitivity-based precision allocation to assign the proper bit-width for each layer within the given budget for weight memory based on their first-order information and quantization error. (3) We develop efficient CUDA core kernels to accelerate mix-precision LLMs by fusing the dequantization and General Matrix-Vector Multiplication (GEMV). With comparable performance on various tasks, LLM-MQ can flexibly quantize LLMs that meet the given budget for weight memory. On NVIDIA T4 GPU, we achieve up to 1.6× end-to-end speedup compared to the pytorch FP16 baseline.",

"abstract": "We devise, implement and performance-asses DYAD, a layer which can serve as a faster and more memory-efficient approximate replacement for linear layers, (nn.Linear() in Pytorch). These layers appear in common subcomponents, such as in the ff module of Transformers. DYAD is based on a bespoke near-sparse matrix structure which approximates the dense weight matrix W that matrix-multiplies the input in the typical realization of such a layer, a.k.a DENSE. Our alternative near-sparse matrix structure is decomposable to a sum of 2 matrices permutable to a block-sparse counterpart. These can be represented as 3D tensors, which in unison allow a faster execution of matrix multiplication with the mini-batched input matrix X compared to DENSE (O(rows(W) × cols(W)) → O(rows(W)×cols(W)/(# of blocks)). As the crux of our experiments, we pretrain both DYAD and DENSE variants of 2 sizes of the OPT arch and 1 size of the Pythia arch, including at different token scales of the babyLM benchmark. We find DYAD to be competitive (≥ 95%) of DENSE performance on zero-shot (e.g. BLIMP), few-shot (OPENLM) and finetuning (GLUE) benchmarks, while being ≥7-15% faster to train on-GPU even at 125m scale, besides surfacing larger speedups at increasing scale and model width.",

"title": "Parameter Efficient Finetuning for Reducing Activation Density in Transformers",
"abstract": "Pretrained Language Models (PLMs) have become the de facto starting point for fine-tuning on downstream tasks. However, as model sizes continue to increase, traditional fine-tuning of all parameters becomes challenging. To address this, parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods have gained popularity as a means to adapt PLMs effectively. In parallel, recent studies have revealed the presence of activation sparsity within the intermediate outputs of the MLP blocks in transformers. Low activation density enables efficient model inference on sparsity-aware hardware. Building upon this insight, in this work, we propose a novel density loss that encourages higher activation sparsity (equivalently, lower activation density) in the pre-trained models. In our experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach DEFT by employing mainstream PEFT techniques like LoRA, Adapter, Prompt/Prefix Tuning. DEFT consistently achieves substantial reductions in activation density. For example, on the T5-Base model, DEFT leads to reductions of average 47.77% in encoder density and 81.82% in decoder density compared to PEFT. These trends are mirrored across various GeLU activation-based models, including ViT-Base (86M), ViT-Large (307M), RoBERTa-Base (125M), RoBERTa-Large (355M), and GPT2 (117M), with density reductions ranging from 29.61% to 56.68%.",

Our experiments with various GQKVA variants highlight a clear trade-off between performance and model size, allowing for customized choices based on resource and time limitations. Our findings also indicate that the conventional multi-head attention approach is not always the best choice, as there are lighter and faster alternatives available. We tested our method on ViT, which achieved an approximate 0.3% increase in accuracy while reducing the model size by about 4% in the task of image classification.

At the core of our method are Labeling Function Removal (LaRe) and Correlation Structure Generation  (CosGen).

"abstract": "Generative Large Language Models (LLMs) based on the Transformer architecture have recently emerged as a dominant foundation model for a wide range of Natural  Language Processing tasks. Nevertheless, their application in real-time scenarios has been highly restricted due to the significant inference latency associated with these models. This is particularly pronounced due to the autoregressive nature of generative LLM inference, where tokens are generated sequentially since each token depends on all previous output tokens. It is therefore challenging to achieve any token-level parallelism, making inference extremely memory-bound. In this work, we propose SPEED, which improves inference efficiency by speculatively executing multiple future tokens in parallel with the current token using predicted values based on early-layer hidden states. For Transformer decoders which employ parameter sharing, the memory operations for the tokens executing in parallel can be amortized, which allows us to accelerate generative LLM inference. We demonstrate the efficiency of our method in terms of latency reduction relative to model accuracy and demonstrate how speculation allows for training deeper decoders with parameter sharing with minimal runtime overhead.",

Furthermore, it is challenging to train models for low-resource languages, especially from scratch, due to a lack of high quality training data. 
Adapting pretrained LLMs reduces the need for data in the new language while also providing cross lingual transfer capabilities. However, naively adapting to new languages leads to catastrophic forgetting and poor tokenizer efficiency.
In this work, we study how to efficiently adapt any existing pretrained LLM to a new language without running into these issues.
In particular, we improve the encoding efficiency of the tokenizer by adding new tokens from the target language and study the data mixing recipe to mitigate forgetting.
Our experiments on adapting an English LLM to Hungarian and Thai show that our recipe can reach better performance than open source models on the target language, with minimal regressions on English.",

In this paper, we study how to optimize the FFT convolution. We find two key bottlenecks: the FFT does not effectively use specialized matrix multiply units, and it incurs expensive I/O between layers of the memory hierarchy. In response, we propose FlashFFTConv. FlashFFTConv uses a matrix decomposition that computes the FFT using matrix multiply units and enables kernel fusion for long sequences, reducing I/O. FlashFFTConv speeds up exact FFT convolutions by up to 6.54x over PyTorch and achieves up to 4.4x speedup end-to-end. Given the same compute budget, FlashFFTConv allows Hyena-GPT-s to achieve 2.3 points better perplexity and M2-BERT-base to achieve 3.3 points higher GLUE score---matching models with twice the parameter count.",

"abstract": "Pretrained transformer models leverage the attention mechanism to capture long- and short-range dependencies in the sequence. However, the (full) attention mechanism incurs high computational cost -- quadratic in the sequence length, which is not affordable in tasks with long sequences, e.g., inputs with 8k tokens. Although sparse attention can be used to improve computational efficiency, as suggested in existing work, it has limited modeling capacity and often fails to capture complicated dependencies in long sequences. To tackle this challenge, we propose MASFormer, an easy-to-implement transformer variant with mixed attention spans. Specifically, MASFormer is equipped with full attention to capture long-range dependencies, but only at a small number of layers. For the remaining layers, MASformer only employs sparse attention to capture short-range dependencies. Our experiments on natural language modeling and generation tasks show that a decoder-only MASFormer model of 1.3B parameters can achieve competitive performance to vanilla transformers with full attention while significantly reducing computational cost (up to 75%).

We begin by collecting generation data from a wide range of LLMs, and train neural detectors on data from each generator and test its performance on held-out generators. While none of the detectors can generalize to all generators, we observe a consistent and interesting pattern that the detectors trained on data from a medium-size LLM can zero-shot generalize to the larger version.

"abstract": "Retrieval-augmented language models have demonstrated remarkable effectiveness, particularly in knowledge-intensive tasks.  Previous studies on retrieval augmentation typically require tuning the parameters of language models or updating the vector datastore, resulting in huge computational costs.  However, it becomes infeasible as the scale of language models and the vector datastore continues to increase, especially when language models are only accessible through APIs.  Hence, we treat the language model as a black box and keep the vector datastore frozen. We propose a lightweight retrieval tuning technique by introducing a self-adapted similarity matching module, employing less than 1M parameters. Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) is utilized to fine-tune the introduced parameters because the black-box language models cannot be trained end-to-end.  Our approach exhibits great scalability as it can be employed in any scenario, regardless of the frozen vector datastore and the black-box language model.  Moreover, our approach has high training efficiency, the speed bottleneck of which lies in the inference of the black-box language models.  Experiments conducted on the MMLU and TrivialQA benchmarks demonstrate that our lightweight retrieval tuning technique significantly improves the performance of retrieval augmentation across different scales and architectures of language models.

The key tradeoff is between the degree of compression and the impact on the quality of the compressed model. Existing research on LLM compression primarily focuses on performance in terms of general metrics like perplexity or downstream task accuracy. More fine-grained metrics, such as those measuring parametric knowledge, remain significantly underexplored. To help bridge this gap, we present a comprehensive analysis across multiple model families (ENCODER, ENCODER-DECODER, and DECODER) using the LAMA and LM-HARNESS benchmarks in order to systematically quantify the effect of commonly employed compression techniques on model performance. A particular focus is on tradeoffs involving parametric knowledge, with the goal of providing practitioners with practical insights to make informed decisions on compression.

However, they often prioritize data that aligns with the target distribution. While this strategy may be effective when training a model from scratch, it can yield limited results when the model has already been pre-trained on a different distribution.

"abstract": "Transformer models, despite their impressive performance, often face practical limitations due to their high computational requirements. At the same time, previous studies have revealed significant activation sparsity in these models, indicating the presence of redundant computations. In this paper, we propose Dynamic Sparsified Transformer Inference (DSTI), a method that radically reduces the inference cost of Transformer models by enforcing activation sparsity and subsequently transforming a dense model into its sparse Mixture of Experts (MoE) version. We demonstrate that it is possible to train small gating networks that successfully predict the relative contribution of each expert during inference. Furthermore, we introduce a mechanism that dynamically determines the number of executed experts individually for each token. DSTI can be applied to any Transformer-based architecture and has negligible impact on the accuracy. For the BERT-base classification model, we reduce inference cost by almost 60%.",

While LLMs have excelled in various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, adapting them for extended dialog contexts poses challenges due to computational overhead and data requirements. LLMs often struggle with fixed context window sizes, limiting their application in lengthy conversations. In this work, we leverage LLMs' contextual learning capabilities using instruction prompts and retrieval-based context augmentation, without any fine-tuning. We focus on long-term dialog modeling, addressing challenges like data independence, avoiding fine-tuning, and accommodating the context of long conversations within shorter windows. Our empirical experiments on two datasets, namely Multi-Session Chat and MultiDoc2Dial demonstrate how including relevant information in LLMs' input context affects dialog generation performance while reducing computational costs associated with longer contexts.",

"abstract": "Code datasets, often collected from diverse and uncontrolled sources such as GitHub, potentially suffer from quality issues, thereby affecting the performance and training efficiency of Large Language Models (LLMs) optimized for code generation. Previous studies demonstrated the benefit of using embedding spaces for data pruning, but they mainly focused on duplicate removal or increasing variety, and in other modalities, such as images. Our work focuses on using embeddings to identify and remove ``low-quality'' code data. First, we explore features of ``low-quality'' code in embedding space, through the use of synthetic corruptions. Armed with this knowledge, we devise novel pruning metrics that operate in embedding space to identify and remove low-quality entries in the Stack dataset. We demonstrate the benefits of this synthetic corruption informed pruning (SCIP) approach on the well-established HumanEval and MBPP benchmarks, outperforming existing embedding-based methods. Importantly, we achieve up to a 3% performance improvement over no pruning, thereby showing the promise of insights from synthetic corruptions for data pruning.",

"abstract": "MEGA is a recent transformer-based architecture, which utilizes a linear recurrent operator whose parallel computation, based on the FFT, scales as O(LlogL), with L being the sequence length. We build upon their approach by replacing the linear recurrence with a special temporal convolutional network which permits larger receptive field size with shallower networks, and reduces the computational complexity to O(L). The resulting model is called TCNCA, a Temporal Convolutional Network with Chunked Attention. We evaluate TCNCA on EnWik8 language modeling, long-range-arena (LRA) sequence classification, as well as a synthetic reasoning benchmark associative recall. On EnWik8, TCNCA outperforms MEGA, reaching a lower loss with 1.37×/1.24× faster forward/backward pass during training. The dilated convolutions used in TCNCA are consistently and significantly faster operations than the FFT-based parallelized recurrence in GPUs, making them a scalable candidate for handling very large sequence lengths: they are up to 7.07×/2.86× faster in the forward/backward pass for sequences up to 131 k. Further on LRA, TCNCA achieves, on average, 1.28× speed-up during inference with similar accuracy to what MEGA achieves. On associative recall, we find that even a simplified version of TCNCA, without excessive multiplicative and additive interactions, remains superior or competitive to MEGA on a range of sequence lengths and vocabulary sizes.",

"abstract": "Finetuned LLMs often exhibit poor uncertainty quantification, manifesting as overconfidence, poor calibration, and unreliable prediction results on test data or out-of-distribution samples. One approach commonly used in vision for alleviating this issue is a deep ensemble, which constructs an ensemble by training the same model multiple times using different random initializations. However, there is a huge challenge to ensembling LLMs: the most effective LLMs are very, very large. Keeping a single LLM in memory is already challenging enough: keeping an ensemble of e.g. 5 LLMs in memory is impossible in many settings. To address these issues, we propose an ensemble approach using Low-Rank Adapters (LoRA), a parameter-efficient fine-tuning technique. Critically, these low-rank adapters represent a very small number of parameters, orders of magnitude less than the underlying pre-trained model. Thus, it is possible to construct large ensembles of LoRA adapters with almost the same computational overhead as using the original model. We find that LoRA ensembles, applied on its own or on top of pre-existing regularization techniques, gives consistent improvements in predictive accuracy and uncertainty quantification.",

"abstract": "The popularity of LLaMA and other recently emerged moderate-sized large language models (LLMs) highlights the potential of building smaller yet powerful LLMs. Regardless, the cost of training such models from scratch on trillions of tokens remains high. In this work, we study structured pruning as an effective means to develop smaller LLMs from pre-trained, larger models. Our approach employs two key techniques:  (1) targeted structured pruning, which prunes a larger model to a specified target shape by removing layers, heads, intermediate and hidden dimensions in an end-to-end manner, and (2) dynamic batch loading, which dynamically updates the composition of sampled data in each training batch based on varying losses across different domains. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach by presenting the Sheared-LLaMA series, pruning the LLaMA2-7B model down to 1.3B and 2.7B parameters. Sheared-LLaMA models outperform state-of-the-art open-source models of equivalent sizes, such as Pythia, INCITE, and OpenLLaMA models, on a wide range of downstream and instruction tuning evaluations, while requiring less than 3% of compute compared to training such models from scratch. This work provides compelling evidence that leveraging existing LLMs with structured pruning is a far more cost-effective approach for building smaller LLMs.",

"abstract": "We consider the problem of accurate \emph{sparse fine-tuning} of large language models (LLMs), that is, fine-tuning pretrained LLMs on specialized tasks, while inducing sparsity in their weights. We observe that standard loss-based fine-tuning may fail to recover accuracy, especially at high sparsities. To address this, we perform a detailed study of distillation-type losses, determining an L2-based distillation approach we term SquareHead which enables accurate recovery even at higher sparsities, across all model types. On the efficiency side, we show that sparse LLMs can be executed with speedups by taking advantage of sparsity, for both CPU and GPU runtimes. While the standard approach is to leverage sparsity for computational reduction, we observe that in the case of memory-bound LLMs sparsity can also be leveraged for reducing memory bandwidth. We exhibit end-to-end results showing speedups due to sparsity, while recovering accuracy, on T5 (language translation), Whisper (speech translation), and open GPT-type (MPT for text generation). For MPT text generation, we show for the first time that sparse fine-tuning can reach 75% sparsity without accuracy drops, provide notable end-to-end speedups for both CPU and GPU inference, and highlight that sparsity is also compatible with quantization approaches.

Based on the recognized structure, we then construct the KV cache in an adaptive manner: evicting long-range contexts on attention heads emphasizing local contexts, discarding non-special tokens on attention heads centered on special tokens, and only employing the standard KV cache for attention heads that broadly attend to all tokens. Moreover, with the lightweight attention profiling used to guide the construction of the adaptive KV cache, FastGen can be deployed without resource-intensive fine-tuning or re-training. In our experiments across various asks, FastGen demonstrates substantial  GPU memory reduction with negligible generation quality loss.",

Although the architecture and constituent building blocks of neural networks usually allow them to be used modularly (i.e., using the sub-networks of a given network after training), their training process is unaware of this modularity. Consequently, conventional neural network training lacks the flexibility to adapt the computational load of the model during inference. This paper proposes SortedNet, a generalized and scalable solution to harness the inherent modularity of deep neural networks across various dimensions (e.g. width, depth, blocks) for efficient dynamic inference. Our training considers a nested architecture for the sub-models with shared parameters and trains all models simultaneously to obtain many-in-one sorted models. We utilize a novel updating scheme during training that combines a random sub-model sampling with gradient accumulation to improve training efficiency. Furthermore, the sorted nature of our training leads to a search-free sub-model selection at inference time; and the nested architecture of the resulting sub-models leads to minimal storage requirement and efficient switching between sub-models at inference. Our general dynamic training approach is demonstrated across various architectures and tasks, including BERT on language understanding and ResNet on image classification. Experimental results show the efficacy of the proposed method in achieving efficient sub-models while outperforming state-of-the-art dynamic training approaches.",

Each Feed Forward Network (FFN) block of a  MatFormer model is jointly optimized with a few nested smaller FFN blocks. This allows for the Mix'n'Match of model granularities across layers -- i.e., a trained universal MatFormer model enables extraction of hundreds of accurate smaller models which were never explicitly optimized.  We empirically demonstrate MatFormer's effectiveness for decoder only language modeling and find that a 2.6B decoder-only MatFormer language model (MatLM) allows us to extract smaller models spanning from 1.5B to 2.6B, each exhibiting comparable validation loss and one-shot downstream evaluations to their independently trained counterparts.

To address these limitations, we develop an efficient algorithm for Online Data Mixing (ODM) that combines elements from both data selection and data mixing.

"abstract": "In the current user-server interaction paradigm of prompted generation with large language model (LLM) on cloud, the server fully controls the generation process, which leaves zero option for users who want to keep the generated text to themselves. We propose LatticeGen, a cooperative framework in which the server still handles most of computation while the user controls the sampling operation. The key idea is that the true generated sequence is mixed with noise tokens by the user and hidden in a noised lattice. Considering potential attack from a hypothetically malicious server and how the user can defend against it, we propose the repeated beam-search attack and the mixing noise scheme. In our experiments we apply LatticeGen to protect both prompt and generation. It is shown that while the noised lattice degrades generation quality, LatticeGen successfully protects the true generation to a remarkable degree under strong attacks (more than 50% of the semantic remains hidden as measured by BERTScore).",

"abstract": "Convolution-based language models are asymptotically more efficient than Transformers as sequence length grows and are increasingly competitive in quality. To better understand the quality differences between these architectures, we pre-train a suite of 14 language models across attention and convolution-based architectures, finding that the SoTA gated convolution architectures still underperform Transformers by up to 2.1 perplexity points on the Pile. Our analysis shows that a single language modeling capability, termed associative recall (AR) accounts for 76% of the perplexity gap on average. The task requires recalling an association from earlier in the context, e.g. Hakuna Matata means no worries...Hakuna Matata it means no → ??. We show via experiments and theory that the associative recall solution encoded by convolution-based models is less parameter efficient than the one encoded by attention. The issue arises because convolution-based models process sequences using fixed filters that do not depend on the input data. Finally, we provide evidence that convolutional models with input-dependent filters can solve AR with improved parameter-efficiency.",

"abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are routinely pre-trained on billions of tokens, only to restart the process over again once new data becomes available. A much cheaper and more efficient solution would be to enable the continual pre-training of these models, i.e. updating pre-trained models with new data instead of re-training them from scratch. However, the distribution shift induced by novel data typically results in degraded performance on past data. Taking a step towards efficient continual pre-training, in this work, we examine the effect of different warm-up strategies. Our hypothesis is that the learning rate must be re-increased to improve compute efficiency when training on a new dataset. We study the warmup phase of models pre-trained on the Pile (upstream data, 300B tokens) as we continue to pre-train on SlimPajama (downstream data, 297B tokens), following a linear warmup and cosine decay schedule. We conduct all experiments on the Pythia 410M language model architecture and evaluate performance through validation perplexity. We experiment with different pre-training checkpoints, various maximum learning rates, and various warmup lengths. Our results show that while rewarming models first increases the loss on upstream and downstream data, in the longer run it improves the downstream performance, outperforming models trained from scratch---even for a large downstream dataset.",

Existing works focus on concatenating retrievals to inputs as context to form the prompt-based inputs.

Besides, inferring such concatenated data would also consume a significant amount of computational resources.
To solve these challenges, we propose \textbf{ReFusion} in this paper, a computation-efficient \textbf{Re}trieval representation \textbf{Fusion} with neural architecture search.

This improved efficiency is applicable to training linear Transformers from scratch, converting finetuned Transformers into linear versions that recover task-specific performance, and converting pretrained Transformers into linear versions for downstream transfer. However, linear attentions often lag behind softmax attention in performance. To address this gap, we identify two key empirical properties of softmax attention missing in linear attentions: low-entropy spiky weights and dot-product monotonicity.  We thus introduce Hedgehog, a learnable linear attention trained to mimic softmax attention by minimizing cross-entropy between attention weights. Experiments show Hedgehog significantly closes the attention performance gap. Hedgehog closes 68.6% of the gap on WikiText-103 when training 125M-parameter linear Transformers from scratch, improving upon prior linear attentions by up to 6 perplexity points (PPL), and recovers >99% of GLUE points when converting finetuned BERT models, outperforming prior methods up to 8.7 points. By linearizing GPT-2, Hedgehog outperforms efficient Transformer alternatives, obtaining state-of-the-art 16.7 perplexity on WikiText-103.",

In this paper, we propose Mixture of Quantized Experts (MoQE) which is a simple weight-only quantization method applying ultra low-bit down to 2-bit quantizations only to expert weights for mitigating the increased memory and latency issues of MoE models. We show that low-bit quantization together with the MoE architecture delivers a reliable model performance while reducing the memory size significantly even without any additional training in most cases. In particular, expert layers in MoE models are much more robust to the quantization than conventional feedforward networks (FFN) layers. In our comprehensive analysis, we show that MoE models with 2-bit expert weights can deliver better model performance than the dense model trained on the same dataset. As a result of low-bit quantization, we show the model size can be reduced by 79.6% of the original half precision floating point (fp16) MoE model. Combined with an optimized GPU runtime implementation, it also achieves 1.24X speed-up on A100 GPUs.",

Our method presents the opportunity to augment any existing instruction-tuning dataset, thereby enriching its content and potential utility.

At generation, these models are used auto-regressively, requiring a forward pass for each generated token, and thus reading the full set of parameters from memory. This memory access forms the primary bottleneck for generation and it worsens as the model size increases. Moreover, executing a forward pass for multiple tokens in parallel often takes nearly the same time as it does for just one token. These two observations lead to the development of speculative sampling, where a second smaller model is used to draft a few tokens, that are then validated or rejected using a single forward pass of the large model. Unfortunately, this method requires two models that share the same tokenizer and thus limits its adoption. As an alternative, we propose to use parallel decoding as a way to draft multiple tokens from a single model with no computational cost, nor the need for a second model. Our approach only requires an additional input token that marks the words that will be generated simultaneously. We show promising performance (up to $30%$ speed-up) while requiring only as few as $O(d_{emb})$ additional parameters.",

To tackle the difficulty of choosing the best model among multiple ones obtained from those choices, one of the effective solutions is model fusion, which combines multiple models on a parameter space. On the other hand, we observe a large discrepancy between loss and actual metric values where a loss is often used to pick out models to fuse. While the loss is generally differentiable and thus easier to optimize, the consideration of metrics is often a preferable goal to improve model performance. In response, we present a novel model fusion technique, optimizing a desired metric as well as a loss using bo. Moreover, combining the multi-objective bo into model fusion, we devise a bilevel framework, composed of bo models for hyperparameter optimization and model fusion. Experiments across various downstream tasks validate decent performance improvements achieved using our bo-based model fusion method.",

Although fine-tuning InstructBLIP has shown great results in downstream tasks, previous works have been restrictive, only full fine-tuning the Q-Former, while freezing the LLM.
In this work, we investigate the performance of the PEFT method, LoRA, on both the Q-Former and the base LLMs, specifically Flan-T5-XL and Vicuna-7B, using visual reasoning benchmarks ScienceQA and IconQA. We observe that, when the LLM is frozen, training the Q-Former with LoRA achieves comparable performance to full fine-tuning using under 2% of the trainable parameters. Furthermore, fine-tuning the LLM consistently result in better performances, regardless of how the Q-Former is fine-tuned.
Lastly, applying LoRA to both the LLM and the Q-Former surpasses the performance of only full fine-tuning the Q-Former while using less than 10% of the trainable parameters.

Navigating the inherent limitations of uniform quantization, particularly when dealing with outliers, and motivated by the launch of NVIDIA's H100 hardware, this study delves into the viability of floating-point (FP) quantization, particularly focusing on FP8 and FP4, as a potential solution. 
Our comprehensive investigation reveals that for LLMs, FP8 activation consistently outshines its integer (INT8) equivalent, with the performance edge becoming more noticeable in models possessing parameters beyond one billion. 
For weight quantization, our findings indicate that FP4 exhibits comparable, if not superior, performance to INT4, simplifying deployment on FP-supported hardware like H100.  To mitigate the overhead from precision alignment caused by the disparity between weights and activations, we propose two scaling constraints for weight quantization that negligibly impact the performance compared to the standard W4A8 model. We additionally enhance our quantization methods by integrating the Low Rank Compensation (LoRC) strategy, yielding improvements especially in smaller models. The results of our investigation emphasize the immense potential of FP quantization for LLMs, paving the way for high-efficiency deployment in resource-limited settings.",

To this end, we present DeepSpeed Data Efficiency, a framework that makes better use of data, increases training efficiency, and improves model quality.

Differently from the recent literature, where multiple models with different architectures are used, in this work we propose using early-exit models. This solution brings 2 benefits: a single model is used on a variety of devices; federating the models is straightforward. Experiments on the public dataset (TED-LIUM 3) show that our proposed approach is effective and can be combined with basic federated learning strategies. We also shed light on how to federate self-attention models for speech recognition, for which an established recipe does not exist in literature.",

"title": "Recursive Joint Cross-Attention for Audio-Visual Speaker Verification",
"abstract": "Speaker verification has been recently gaining a lot of attention using audio-visual fusion as faces and voices share close associations with each other. Though existing approaches based on audio-visual fusion showed improvement over unimodal systems, the potential of audio-visual fusion for speaker verification is not fully exploited. In this paper, we have investigated the prospect of effectively capturing both the intra- and inter-modal relationships across audio and visual modalities simultaneously, which can play a crucial role in significantly improving the fusion performance over unimodal systems. Specifically, we introduce a recursive fusion of the joint cross-attentional model, where a joint audio-visual feature representation is employed in the cross-attention framework in a recursive fashion in order to obtain more refined feature representations that can efficiently capture the intra- and inter-modal associations. Extensive experiments are conducted on the Voxceleb1 dataset to evaluate the proposed model. Results indicate that the proposed model is found to be promising in improving the performance of the audio-visual system.",

"title": "Efficient infusion of self-supervised representations in Automatic Speech Recognition",
"abstract": "Self-supervised learned (SSL) models such as Wav2vec and HuBERT yield state-of-the-art results on speech-related tasks. Given the effectiveness of such models, it is advantageous to use them in conventional ASR systems. While some approaches suggest incorporating these models as a trainable encoder or a learnable frontend, training such systems is extremely slow and requires a lot of computation cycles. In this work, we propose two simple approaches that use (1) framewise addition and (2) cross-attention mechanisms to efficiently incorporate the representations from the SSL model(s) into the ASR architecture, resulting in models that are comparable in size with standard encoder-decoder conformer systems while also avoiding the usage of SSL models during training. Our approach results in faster training and yields significant performance gains on the Librispeech and Tedlium datasets compared to baselines. We further provide detailed analysis and ablation studies that demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.",

"title": "An efficient clustering algorithm for self-supervised speaker recognition",
"abstract": "Clustering-based pseudo-labels (PLs) are widely used to optimize speaker embedding (SE) networks and train self-supervised speaker verification (SV) systems. However, PL-based self-supervised training depends on high-quality PLs and clustering performance relies heavily on time- and resource-consuming data augmentation regularization. In this paper, we propose an efficient and general-purpose multi-objective clustering algorithm that outperforms all other baselines used to cluster SEs.
Our approach avoids explicit data augmentation for fast training and low memory and compute resource usage. 
It is based on three principles: (1) Self-Augmented Training to enforce representation invariance and maximize the information-theoretic dependency between samples and their predicted PLs (2) Virtual Mixup Training to impose local-Lipschitzness and enforce the cluster assumption (3) Supervised contrastive learning to learn more discriminative features and pull samples of same class together and push apart samples of different clusters, while improving robustness to natural corruptions. We provide a thorough comparative analysis of the performance of our clustering method vs. baselines using a variety of clustering metrics and show that we outperform all other clustering benchmarks, perform an ablation study to analyze the contribution of each component including two other augmentation-based objectives, and show that our multi-objective approach provides beneficial complementary information. Moreover, using the generated PLs to train our SE system allows us to achieve state-of-the-art SV performance.",

"abstract": "In the realm of Natural Language Processing, Language Models (LMs) excel in various tasks but face challenges in identifying hate contexts while considering zero-shot or transfer learning issues. To address this, we introduce Space Modeling (SM), a novel approach that enhances hate context detection by generating word-level attribution and bias scores. These scores provide intuitive insights into model predictions and aid in the recognition of hateful terms. Our experiments across six hatespeech datasets reveal SM's superiority over existing methods, marking a significant advancement in refining LM-based hate context detection.",

"title": "Revealing the Bias in Large Language Models via Reward Based Questioning",
"abstract": "The success of large language models has been utterly demonstrated in recent times. Using these models and fine tuning for the specific task at hand results in high performance. However, these models also learn biased representations from the data they have been trained on. In particular, several studies recently showed that language models can learn to be biased towards certain genders. Quite recently, several studies tried to eliminate this bias via proposing human feedback included in fine-tuning. In our study we show that by changing the question asked to the language model the log probabilities of the bias measured in the responses changes dramatically. Furthermore, in several cases the language model ends up providing a completely opposite response. The recent language models finetuned on the prior gender bias datasets do not resolve the actual problem, but rather alleviate the problem for the dataset on which the model is fine-tuned. We believe our results might lay the foundation for further alignment and safety problems in large language models.",

"title": "Evaluating task specific finetuning for protein language models",
"abstract": "Prediction methods inputting embeddings from protein Language Models (pLMs) have reached or even surpassed state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on many protein prediction tasks.  In natural language processing (NLP) fine-tuning Language Models has become the de facto standard. In contrast, most protein-prediction tasks do not backpropagate to the pLM. Here, we compared the use of pretrained embeddings to fine-tuning three SOTA pLMs (ESM2, ProtT5, Ankh) on eight different tasks. Two results stood out: (1) task-specific supervised fine-tunig mostly increased downstream prediction performance. (2) Parameter-efficient fine-tuning could reach similar improvements consuming substantially fewer resources. These findings suggest task-specific fine-tuning as a generic improvement of pLM-based prediction methods. To help kick-off such an advance, we provided easy-to-use notebooks for parameter efficient fine-tuning of ProtT5 for per-protein (pooling) and per-residue prediction tasks at (link will be added in final version).",
